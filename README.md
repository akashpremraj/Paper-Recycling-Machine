## üìñ Project Overview
This is my **final year project**: the design and fabrication of a **compact paper recycling machine**.  
The machine integrates **pulping, forming, press rolling, and drying** into one unit.  
It is aimed at schools, colleges, offices, and small industries where a large-scale plant is not feasible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Flow

1. **Pulping** ‚Äî Shredded waste paper is mixed with water in the hydropulper.  
2. **Forming** ‚Äî Slurry drains on a felt conveyor to form a wet sheet.  
3. **Press Rolling** ‚Äî Rollers squeeze out water and compact the sheet.  
4. **Drying** ‚Äî Heated cylinder and airflow dry the paper.

### Dryer Cylinder

| Parameter          | Symbol | Value   |
|-------------------|:------:|:-------:|
| Radius            |  r     | 7 cm    |
| Circumference     |  C     | 43.99 cm |
| Length (heated)   |   L    | 50 cm   |

### Drive & Speed Calculations

- Motor: 1 HP, AC, 3-phase, **900 rpm**  
- Gearbox: **42:1** ‚Üí output ‚âà 21.43 rpm  
- Pulley ratio: **1:2** ‚Üí roller ‚âà 42.86 rpm  
- Dryer circumference: **43.99 cm**

**Linear web speed**  
v = rpm √ó C = 42.86 √ó 43.99 cm/min = **18.85 m/min**
