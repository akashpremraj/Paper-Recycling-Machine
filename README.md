# DESIGN AND FABRICATION OF PAPER RECYCLING MACHINE

This is my final year project (2019–2020) submitted to **Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belagavi**,  
carried out in the **Department of Mechanical Engineering, Srinivas Institute of Technology, Mangaluru**.

## Project Description

This project is about designing and fabricating a **small-scale paper recycling machine** that can be
used in institutions such as schools and colleges. Paper waste is generated in large amounts in
such places, and recycling it on-site is both cost-effective and environmentally beneficial.

I designed a compact unit that performs four main processes of paper recycling:  
**pulping, forming, pressing, and drying**. The machine was built to be **low-cost, simple, and
educational**, making it easy for students and institutions to adopt.

## Objectives

- To design and fabricate an economical and efficient paper recycling unit.  
- To recycle waste paper generated within institutions.  
- To raise awareness of sustainability and recycling among students.  
- To reduce the use of fresh wood pulp and thereby help in reducing deforestation.

## Working Principle

1. **Pulping** – Waste paper is shredded and mixed with hot water and small additives in a pulper to create fiber slurry.  
2. **Forming** – The slurry is spread on a mesh conveyor where water drains naturally.  
3. **Press Rolling** – Rollers press the wet sheet to remove more water.  
4. **Drying** – A heated roller and blower remove the remaining moisture, producing usable recycled paper sheets.

## Results & Conclusion

- The machine I designed and built was successful in producing recycled paper sheets.  
- It is a **low-cost solution** that can be adopted in colleges and schools for practical demonstrations.  
- The project also serves as an educational model to spread awareness about recycling and environmental protection.

## Future Scope

- Semi-automatic controls can be added for faster and more efficient operation.  
- Improved heating and drying methods can increase production rate.  
- The design can be scaled up for use in small industries or community-level recycling.  
- Further research can be done on using natural additives to improve pulp quality.

## Author’s Note

This project gave me hands-on experience in design, fabrication, and problem solving. It also
taught me how engineering can directly contribute to sustainability and environmental protection.
