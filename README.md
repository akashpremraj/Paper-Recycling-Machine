## üìñ Project Overview
This is my **final year project**: the design and fabrication of a **compact paper recycling machine**.  
The machine integrates **pulping, forming, press rolling, and drying** into one unit.  
It is aimed at schools, colleges, offices, and small industries where a large-scale plant is not feasible.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Flow

1. **Pulping** ‚Äî Shredded waste paper is mixed with water in the hydropulper.  
2. **Forming** ‚Äî Slurry drains on a felt conveyor to form a wet sheet.  
3. **Press Rolling** ‚Äî Rollers squeeze out water and compact the sheet.  
4. **Drying** ‚Äî Heated cylinder and airflow dry the paper.

- Energy-efficient operation (1 HP motor with gearbox)  
- Easy to maintain and operate  
- Reduces environmental waste by recycling used paper  
- Quick turnaround ‚Äî sheets produced in minutes  

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages

- Limited production capacity (small batch size only)  
- Not suitable for industrial-scale recycling  
- Requires manual feeding and supervision  
- Drying section efficiency depends on local conditions (temperature, humidity)  
- Paper quality may not match commercial-grade standards  

---

## üî≠ Scope for Future Work

- Automating slurry feeding and sheet cutting  
- Increasing production capacity with wider conveyor and larger rollers  
- Integration of temperature-controlled dryer for consistent sheet quality  
- Addition of sensors and PLC for semi-automatic operation  
- Developing portable/mobile versions for schools and community centers  
- Using renewable energy (solar power) to improve sustainability  


## ‚úçÔ∏è Author‚Äôs Note

I, **Akash P Raj**, carried out this project work as part of my **final year Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering** at **Srinivas Institute of Technology, Mangaluru**, under the guidance of **Prof. Gangadhara Rao**.  

This project was completed within **one month (June‚ÄìJuly 2020)**, covering design, fabrication, testing, and documentation.  

I sincerely thank my guide, coordinators, faculty, and my project teammates for their contributions and encouragement.
