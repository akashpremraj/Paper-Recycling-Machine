## 📖 Project Overview

A compact, low-cost **paper recycling machine** that integrates **pulping → forming → press rolling → drying** into a single bench-scale line. It’s designed for **schools, colleges, offices, and small units** where a full-scale mill isn’t viable, prioritising **safety, footprint, and ease of operation**.

**Why this matters**
- Diverts paper waste from bins; demonstrates **closed-loop recycling** on-site.
- Converts mixed office waste into **usable A5/A4 craft sheets** for teaching or prototyping.
- Shows practical integration of **mechanical design, fluid handling, heat transfer, and controls**.

**Scope & objectives**
- Build an integrated prototype with **continuous conveyor forming** and **heated drying**.
- Achieve **stable sheet formation**, reduce moisture via **press rolling**, and **dry to handle** state.
- Emphasise **operator safety** (guards, e-stop, thermal caution) and **simple maintenance** (belt tensioning, cleaning SOP).

**Out of scope**
- Industrial-grade calendaring/sizing, high-speed web control, or commercial grammage certification (the unit is for **demonstration and training**).

---

## ⚙️ Process Flow

1. **Pulping** → Shredded waste paper + water in a **hydropulper** to create slurry (target consistency ~2–3%).  
2. **Forming** → Slurry is deposited onto a **moving felt conveyor**; water drains by gravity/mesh to form a wet mat.  
3. **Press Rolling** → **Paired rollers** squeeze the web to expel free water and improve fibre bonding.  
4. **Drying** → **Heated cylinder** with assisted airflow dries the sheet to a handleable moisture level.

## 📐 Design Data & Calculations

### Hydropulper (cylindrical vessel)

**Given (from report draft):** wall thickness `t = 0.022 cm`, radius `r = 0.95 cm`, height `h = 50 cm`, volume `V = 62,930 cm³ (≈ 62.9 L)`.

**Sanity-check:** For a right cylinder, \( V = \pi r^2 h \).

- If `h = 50 cm` and `V = 62,930 cm³`, then  
  \( r = \sqrt{V / (\pi h)} ≈ \sqrt{62,930 / (3.1416 × 50)} ≈ 20.0 cm \).

> ⚠️ This shows the stated **`r = 0.95 cm`** is a unit/typo error.  
> To match your volume and height, use **`r ≈ 20.0 cm` (diameter ≈ 40 cm)**.

#### Finalised hydropulper parameters (used for calcs)

| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| Wall thickness | `t` | 0.022 cm (0.22 mm) | From vessel spec |
| **Radius (corrected)** | `r` | **20.0 cm** | Matches `V` and `h` |
| Height | `h` | 50 cm | Cylindrical shell height |
| **Volume** | `V` | **62,930 cm³ (≈ 62.9 L)** | \( \pi r^2 h \) |

**Batch sizing & consistency (rule-of-thumb):**
- At **2.5% consistency**, paper solids per batch ≈ `0.025 × 62.9 L ≈ 1.57 kg` wet-basis equivalent.
- Useful for planning **press load** and **dryer time** targets downstream.

> If you prefer to keep the originally printed radius, adjust the height to keep the same volume, or update the volume to match the printed dimensions. Keeping **volume** fixed is most practical because downstream timings were likely derived from it.

### Conveyor Felt

| Attribute | Value | Notes |
|---:|---|---|
| **Length** | 3.9–4.0 m | Provides drainage **dwell length** before the press nip. |
| **Width** | 13 in (≈ **330 mm**) | Matches target sheet width and roller span. |
| **Material** | Nylon / PVC felt (porous) | Promotes drainage; compatible with wet end chemistry. |
| **Thickness** | 2–4 mm (typ.) | Stiff enough to track; compliant enough for nip. |
| **Speed (line)** | **v** = 0.2–0.5 m/s (demo mode) | Tune to balance drainage vs throughput. |
| **Tension** | 150–300 N total (bench) | Set to avoid slip; check bearing load. |
| **Tracking** | Crowned roller or edge guides | Prevents walk-off; add alignment marks. |
| **Cleaning** | Squeegee + low-pressure spray | Reduces fibre carry-over and blinding. |

**Useful relations**
- **Drainage dwell time:** \( t_{\text{dwell}} = \dfrac{L_{\text{felt}}}{v} \).  
  *Example:* \( L=4.0\,\text{m},\ v=0.3\,\text{m·s}^{-1} \Rightarrow t \approx 13.3\,\text{s} \).
- **Felt speed = line speed:** keep drive ratios 1:1 (no shear).

> See **docs/sop_operations.md** for belt tensioning and tracking, and **docs/safety-and-risks.md** for wet-floor and rotating-machinery hazards.

### Dryer Cylinder

| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Notes |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Radius** | \( r \) | **7 cm** | Bench-scale heated drum. |
| **Circumference** | \( C = 2\pi r \) | **≈ 43.98 cm** | Using \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \). |
| **Heated length** | \( L \) | **50 cm** | Effective contact width. |
| **Wrap angle** | \( \theta \) | 120–180° (typ.) | With idler to increase dwell. |
| **Surface temperature** | \( T_s \) | 80–110 °C (demo) | Adjust for paper grammage & safety. |

**Kinematics**
- **Surface speed:** \( v_s = \omega r \) → **match** to conveyor line speed \( v \) (no slip).
- **Thermal dwell (on drum):** \( t_{\text{drum}} \approx \dfrac{\theta\,r}{v} \) (θ in radians).  
  *Example:* \( \theta = \pi \), \( r=0.07\,\text{m} \), \( v=0.3\,\text{m·s}^{-1} \Rightarrow t \approx 0.73\,\text{s} \).

**Heat-of-drying (rule-of-thumb placeholders)**
- **Load to heat web:** \( \dot Q_{\text{sens}} \approx \dot m_{\text{web}} c_p \Delta T \).  
- **Load to evaporate water:** \( \dot Q_{\text{lat}} \approx \dot m_{\text{water}} h_{fg} \).  
  Use these to choose heater rating; start low and step up under guarded conditions.

**Safety & controls**
- Guard hot surfaces; mark **HOT** zones.  
- Fit thermostat + thermal cut-out; verify earth/insulation.  
- Use a **nip guard** at the drum/idler contact.

> Add a photo or sketch of the **wrap/idler arrangement** to `images/` and reference it here for clarity.

## ⚙️ Drive & Speed Calculations

- **Motor:** 1 HP, AC, 3-phase, **900 rpm**
- **Gearbox:** **42:1** → output ≈ **21.43 rpm**
- **Pulley step-up:** **1:2** on the gearbox output → roller ≈ **42.86 rpm**  
  > (Driver pulley ≈ 2× the driven pulley to double speed.)
- **Dryer circumference:** **C ≈ 2πr = 2π·0.07 m ≈ 0.4399 m**

**Linear web speed**

\[
v \;=\; \text{rpm} \times C
\;=\; 42.86 \times 0.4399\;\text{m·min}^{-1}
\;\approx\; \mathbf{18.85\;m·min^{-1}} \;(\mathbf{0.314\;m·s^{-1}})
\]

> Keep the **drum surface speed** matched to the conveyor to avoid shear/slip.

## 🔧 Press Nip Pressure (estimated)

**Definitions**

- **Line load (per unit width):** \(N'\) \([N·m^{-1}]\) — what paper engineers typically quote.
- **Average nip pressure:** \(p\) \([Pa]\) — approx. average across the contact patch.  
- **Geometry:** effective width \(w\), nip contact length \(a\) (in the machine direction).

**From measured/assumed line load**

\[
p \;\approx\; \frac{N'}{a}
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
N \;=\; N' \cdot w,
\]
\[
\text{with area of contact } A \approx w \cdot a \;\Rightarrow\; p \approx \frac{N}{A}.
\]

**Your stated example**  
\(w = 0.33\,\text{m},\; a = 5\,\text{mm} = 0.005\,\text{m},\; N' \approx 16{,}500\,\text{N·m}^{-1}\)

- Total line force: \(N = N' \cdot w \approx 16{,}500 \times 0.33 \approx 5{,}445\,\text{N}\)
- Contact area: \(A = w \cdot a \approx 0.33 \times 0.005 = 0.00165\,\text{m}^2\)
- **Estimated pressure:**  
  \[
  p \approx \frac{5{,}445}{0.00165} \approx \mathbf{3.3\;MPa}
  \]
> Your previous 9.9 MPa appears to be a 3× arithmetic slip. For the given \(N'\) and \(a\), the consistent estimate is **≈ 3.3 MPa**.

---

### Deriving line load from cylinders (handy for BOM/SOP)

If the nip is applied by **two pneumatic cylinders**:

\[
F_{\text{total}} = n \cdot \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \cdot P, 
\qquad
N' = \frac{F_{\text{total}}}{w}
\]

- \(n\): number of cylinders (typically **2**)  
- \(d\): bore diameter (m)  
- \(P\): line pressure (Pa) — **5 bar = 5×10^5 Pa**  
- \(w\): effective press width (m)

**Examples at 5 bar, \(w=0.33\) m, \(n=2\):**

| Bore \(d\) | \(F_{\text{total}}\) (N) | \(N'\) (N·m⁻¹) |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 32 mm | 804 | 2,437 |
| 50 mm | 1,963 | 5,950 |
| 63 mm | 3,117 | 9,446 |
| 80 mm | 5,027 | 15,232 |
| **83 mm** | **≈ 5,445** | **≈ 16,500** |

> To reach your **\(N' \approx 16{,}500\;N·m^{-1}\)** at **5 bar**, you’d need roughly **two 83 mm** bore cylinders (or smaller bores at higher pressure).  
> Once \(N'\) is set, use \(p \approx N'/a\) to tune the nip (reduce \(p\) by increasing the contact length \(a\) or lowering \(N'\)).

**Safety notes (to echo in docs/safety-and-risks.md)**
- Guard the nip; add interlocked covers if feasible.  
- Fit a regulator + gauge and **lock-out/tag-out (LOTO)**.  
- Vent air before maintenance; verify residual energy is zero.
