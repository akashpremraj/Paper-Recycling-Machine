## üìñ Project Overview

A compact, low-cost **paper recycling machine** that integrates **pulping ‚Üí forming ‚Üí press rolling ‚Üí drying** into a single bench-scale line. It‚Äôs designed for **schools, colleges, offices, and small units** where a full-scale mill isn‚Äôt viable, prioritising **safety, footprint, and ease of operation**.

**Why this matters**
- Diverts paper waste from bins; demonstrates **closed-loop recycling** on-site.
- Converts mixed office waste into **usable A5/A4 craft sheets** for teaching or prototyping.
- Shows practical integration of **mechanical design, fluid handling, heat transfer, and controls**.

**Scope & objectives**
- Build an integrated prototype with **continuous conveyor forming** and **heated drying**.
- Achieve **stable sheet formation**, reduce moisture via **press rolling**, and **dry to handle** state.
- Emphasise **operator safety** (guards, e-stop, thermal caution) and **simple maintenance** (belt tensioning, cleaning SOP).

**Out of scope**
- Industrial-grade calendaring/sizing, high-speed web control, or commercial grammage certification (the unit is for **demonstration and training**).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process Flow

1. **Pulping** ‚Üí Shredded waste paper + water in a **hydropulper** to create slurry (target consistency ~2‚Äì3%).  
2. **Forming** ‚Üí Slurry is deposited onto a **moving felt conveyor**; water drains by gravity/mesh to form a wet mat.  
3. **Press Rolling** ‚Üí **Paired rollers** squeeze the web to expel free water and improve fibre bonding.  
4. **Drying** ‚Üí **Heated cylinder** with assisted airflow dries the sheet to a handleable moisture level.
