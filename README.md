# Paper Recycling Machine — Final Year Project

Author: **Akash P Raj**  
Duration: **1 month**

## Project Overview
This project presents the **design and fabrication of a paper recycling machine**. The machine combines pulping, forming, press rolling, and drying into one compact system.  
It is aimed at schools, colleges, offices, and small industries where waste-paper recycling is essential but large industrial systems are not feasible.

## Process Flow

1. **Pulping:** Shredded waste paper is mixed with water and chemicals in the hydropulper.  
2. **Forming:** The slurry drains by gravity on a felt conveyor to form a wet sheet.  
3. **Press Rolling:** Rollers squeeze out excess water.  
4. **Drying:** A heated cylinder and airflow dry the sheet.
