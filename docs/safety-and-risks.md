## Major hazards and controls

| Hazard | Risk | Engineering controls | Admin / PPE |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rotating parts (belts, pulleys, shafts) | Entanglement, laceration | Fixed guards; belt covers (tool-removal only) | No loose clothing/jewellery; hair tied; training |
| Press nip (paired rollers) | Crush/shear | Nip guard; guarded gap adjustment | Use tools for threading; two-person supervision |
| Drum wrap (dryer + idler) | Pinch/burn | Wrap cover; barrier near entry | Supervise threading near hot drum |
| Hot surfaces (drum, duct, heater) | Burns/fire | Thermostat + thermal cut-out; **HOT** labels | Heat-resistant gloves; cool-down before cleaning |
| Wet floor / drainage | Slips/falls | Drip trays; hose routing; non-slip mat | Housekeeping; signage during cleaning |
| Pneumatics (stored energy) | Ejection/impact | Regulator + gauge; quick-exhaust away from operator | **LOTO**; vent to **0 bar** before work |
| Electrical panel | Shock/fire | IP-rated enclosure; MCB/overload; earthing | Panel shut during operation; qualified access only |


## Daily safety checklist (tick in logbook)

- ☐ E-stop test passes; reset verified  
- ☐ Guards fitted and secure (belts, press, drum wrap)  
- ☐ Regulator set to __ bar; no leaks heard/felt  
- ☐ Felt tracking/tension OK; cleaning spray working  
- ☐ Heater thermostat set to __ °C; cut-out test (weekly) scheduled  
- ☐ Floor dry; drip trays empty; anti-slip footwear in use  
- ☐ Panel closed; no damaged leads or exposed conductors


## Start-up / operation / shutdown (summary)

- **Start-up:** conveyor low speed → hydropulper to ~2–3% → set press line load → heater ON and ramp slowly.  
- **While running:** keep hands/tools away; match drum/felt speeds; maintain housekeeping; record v, N′/P, Ts, moisture.  
- **Shutdown:** stop feed → heater OFF (fan purge 2–3 min) → depressurise to 0 bar → release press → stop drives → clean after cool-down.

Full steps: **docs/sop_operations.md**.


## Emergency actions

- **Any unsafe condition:** hit **E-STOP**; isolate power if needed.
- **Entanglement:** E-STOP; do **not** reverse drive; call assistance.
- **Burns:** cool running water 10–20 min; remove rings; seek medical help.
- **Electrical smell/smoke:** E-STOP; isolate; evacuate if required.
- **Burst hose / violent air leak:** E-STOP; isolate air; wait until gauges read **0 bar**.


## Maintenance & inspection

- **Weekly:** thermal cut-out test; belt alignment; fastener torque check.  
- **Monthly:** guard condition; bearing noise/temperature; pneumatic leak test; earth continuity.  
- **Quarterly:** wiring inspection; SSR/contactor check; regulator service.
