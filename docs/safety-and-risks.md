# Safety & Risks — Paper Recycling Machine

## Major hazards
- **Nip points** (press & drum wrap): crush/shear risk.
- **Hot surfaces** (dryer drum, duct): burn risk.
- **Wet floors** (drainage area): slip hazard.
- **Rotating parts** (belts, pulleys): entanglement.
- **Electrical** (heater, drives): shock/fire.
- **Compressed air**: stored energy, flying debris.

## Controls (engineering + admin)
- Fixed guards on belts and rotating shafts.
- Nip guard over press and drum–idler wrap.
- E-stop on accessible panel; function tested each shift.
- Thermostat + thermal cut-out; clearly marked HOT zones.
- Regulator + gauge; LOTO procedure posted at panel.
- Housekeeping: drip trays; anti-slip mats in drainage zone.
- PPE: gloves (heat-resistant near dryer), eye protection, non-slip footwear.

## Procedures
- Start-up and shutdown per **SOP**.
- No loose clothing or jewellery; tie back long hair.
- Never bypass guards or interlocks.
- LOTO before maintenance; verify zero energy (electrical & pneumatic).
