# Process Log (Human-readable)

> This is a narrative roll-up of the CSV log. Use it for weekly summaries and reflections.
> Detailed entries live in `docs/process_log.csv`.

## 2025-09 (Modernisation)
- **2025-09-28** — README overhaul (overview, flow diagram, drive/speed, press calcs, results/log); safety docs; BOM cleaned; citation and issue template added.  
  *Reflection:* Most reviewer questions should now be answerable directly from the README. Next: optional PLC/controls stub.

## 2020-06 to 2020-07 (Project month — reconstructed)
- **2020-06-26** — First stable wet run; outlet moisture ~1.3 kg/kg at N′ ≈ 15.2 kN/m, Ts ~90 °C.  
- **2020-06-28** — Added squeegee; improved consistency; outlet moisture ~1.0 kg/kg at Ts ~100 °C.  
  *Reflection:* Press dwell and felt cleanliness had bigger impact than higher pressure alone.

### Conventions
- Write dates as **YYYY-MM-DD**.
- Keep bullets short: *what changed*, *evidence*, *what’s next*.
- For raw data and timings, update `docs/testing_log.csv`.
