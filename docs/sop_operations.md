# SOP — Operations (Paper Recycling Machine)

## 1. Pre-start checks (5 min)
- Inspect guards, belts, and roller nip covers.
- Verify e-stop works; reset after test.
- Check felt tracking and tension.
- Empty drip trays; confirm floor is dry and clear.
- Pneumatics: regulator at setpoint, no visible leaks.
- Electrical: panel closed, heater thermostat at LOW to start.

## 2. Start-up sequence
1) Power ON → panel indicator ON.  
2) Start **conveyor/felt** at low speed.  
3) Start **hydropulper**; charge water and paper; mix to ~2–3% consistency.  
4) Enable **feed tray**; verify uniform deposition.  
5) Engage **press cylinders** to initial set N′ (as per logbook).  
6) Enable **dryer heater**; ramp to target Ts (80–110 °C).

## 3. Normal operation
- Keep drum and felt speeds matched (no shear).
- Check felt cleaning spray every 10–15 min.
- Record: v, N′ (or P), Ts, inlet/outlet moisture, and any observations.

## 4. Shutdown (normal)
1) Stop feed → let sheet clear the dryer.  
2) Heater OFF → fan purge 2–3 min.  
3) Release press (vent pneumatics).  
4) Stop conveyor; stop hydropulper.  
5) Clean felt (squeegee) and wipe hot surfaces after cool-down.  
6) LOTO if maintenance is required.

## 5. Cleaning
- Hydropulper: drain, rinse, and flush lines.  
- Felt: squeegee + low-pressure spray until runoff is clear.  
- Floor: dry; place “Wet Floor” sign during cleaning.

## 6. Faults & responses
- Sheet breaks → stop feed; reduce N′ and v; re-thread.  
- Felt walking → adjust tracking guides; stop if edge frays.  
- Over-temp → heater OFF, investigate thermostat/SSR.  
- Air leak → LOTO, depressurise, fix fittings/seals.

## 7. Records
Logbook fields: date/time, operator, paper type, v, P/N′, Ts, inlet/outlet mass, issues/actions.
