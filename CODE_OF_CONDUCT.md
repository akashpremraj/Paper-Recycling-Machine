# Code of Conduct

## Our pledge
We aim to create a welcoming, harassment-free space for learning and collaboration. We commit to treating everyone with respect, regardless of age, ability, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion (or lack thereof), or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards
Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
- Harassment, trolling, or personal attacks
- Public or private harassment, or publishing othersâ€™ private information
- Sexualised language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention
- Sustained disruption of discussions

## Scope
This Code applies in all project spaces (GitHub issues, PRs, discussions, docs) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Reporting
If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, please report it to the maintainer:
- **Maintainer:** Akash P Raj  
- **Contact:** open an issue marked **private info to share** and a maintainer will provide a direct email, or share only non-sensitive details in public and request a private channel.

Reports will be reviewed promptly and kept as confidential as possible.

## Enforcement
- The maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warnings, temporary or permanent bans from project spaces, or declining contributions that do not align with this Code.
- Consequences will be proportionate to the behaviour and context.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted in spirit from the Contributor Covenant (v2.1) and other open source guidelines. For the full text of the Contributor Covenant, see: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/
